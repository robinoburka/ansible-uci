This is Ansible module for manipulation with UCI configuration files.

Introduction
============

UCI files are similar to ini configuration files. It is key-value storage with
sections. The UCI file could be edited by many different tools (LuCI, uci
command line tool, libuci) and these tools doesn't preserve the structure of file.
Therefore, the UCI file is primitive database much more than configuration file.

There are many reasons why are standard tools insufficient. Is difficult to
edit the line in section with lineinfile module. Modules like copy or template
doesn't respect the dynamic structure of file.

So, I believe the module for direct manipulation with UCI configuration is the
best way to do it.

Installation
============

The file uci.py must be located in Ansible's path for modules. E.g. in the
directory called "library" in the current working directory.

See the documentation of Ansible for the different ways of installation.

Usage
=====

Usage is documented in file uci.py in variables DOCUMENTATION and EXAMPLES (as
upstream requires).
